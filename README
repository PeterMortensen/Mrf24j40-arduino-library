The Microchip MRF24J40MA is an 802.15.4 module, with an SPI interface.  It's nice and cheap, and it is readily usable on a breadboard, unlike XBee modules.  More information is in http://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/Devices.aspx?dDocName=en535967

This library provides a basic interface to send and receive packets using plain 802.15.4.  Beacon mode is not supported.
